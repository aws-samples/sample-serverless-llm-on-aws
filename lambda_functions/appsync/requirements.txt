# AWS AppSync AI Streaming Lambda Function Dependencies
#
# This requirements.txt file specifies the AWS SDK dependencies needed for 
# AppSync GraphQL resolvers that handle real-time AI streaming functionality.
#
# DEPENDENCY RATIONALE FOR APPSYNC ARCHITECTURE:
#
# Unlike WebSocket API or Lambda URL patterns, AppSync GraphQL resolvers primarily
# use the AWS SDK for service-to-service communication. The core dependencies are:
#
# 1. boto3 - AWS SDK for Python (High-level interface)
#    - Used for Lambda-to-Lambda invocation (async worker pattern)
#    - Used for Bedrock AI model streaming invocation
#    - Provides resource-level abstractions for AWS services
#    - Handles credential management and service discovery
#    - Required for all AWS service interactions in this architecture
#
# 2. botocore - AWS SDK Core Library (Low-level interface)
#    - Required by boto3 as the underlying transport layer
#    - Provides SigV4 authentication for service-to-service calls
#    - Handles AWS request signing for AppSync GraphQL mutations
#    - Manages retry logic and error handling for AWS API calls
#    - Essential for programmatic GraphQL mutation execution from Lambda
#
# APPSYNC-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
#
# No JWT Libraries Needed:
# - AppSync handles authentication via Cognito User Pools directly
# - GraphQL resolvers receive pre-authenticated context from AppSync
# - No manual JWT validation required in resolver functions
#
# No WebSocket Libraries Needed:
# - AppSync manages WebSocket connections automatically
# - Real-time subscriptions handled by AppSync infrastructure
# - No manual connection management required
#
# Service-to-Service Authentication:
# - Uses IAM roles and SigV4 signing via botocore
# - Lambda execution roles provide necessary permissions
# - No manual credential management in application code
#
# ARCHITECTURE PATTERN SUMMARY:
#
# This AppSync streaming architecture demonstrates:
# - GraphQL mutations and subscriptions for real-time data
# - Asynchronous Lambda invocation for long-running processes  
# - SigV4 authentication for secure service-to-service communication
# - Bedrock integration for AI model streaming
# - Session-based real-time broadcasting to connected clients
#
# VERSION CONSTRAINTS:
# - boto3>=1.28.0: Ensures Bedrock streaming support and latest features
# - botocore>=1.31.0: Provides updated SigV4 auth and retry mechanisms
#
# Lambda Layer Usage:
# These dependencies are packaged into a Lambda Layer via CDK's PythonLayerVersion
# construct for efficient reuse across multiple AppSync resolver functions.

boto3>=1.28.0     # AWS SDK for service integrations (Bedrock, Lambda invocation)
botocore>=1.31.0  # Core AWS SDK library (SigV4 auth, HTTP transport)
